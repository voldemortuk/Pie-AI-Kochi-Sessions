Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don’t think AI (Artificial Intelligence) will transform in the next several years.” ~Andrew Ng

 Pie & AI is a series of deeplearning.ai meetups independently hosted by community groups.
 Whether you want to build algorithms or build a company, deeplearning. ai's courses will teach you key concepts and applications of AI.
