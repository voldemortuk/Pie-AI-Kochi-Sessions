Pie & AI is a series of DeepLearning.AI meetups independently hosted by community groups. This event is hosted by event ambassador [Utkarsh Raj](https://voldemortuk.github.io) & Arya Vinod. Special thanks to their support!

A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. 

In this session, Vishnu Anilkumar walk us through the same and talk about the best practices , latest trends and itâ€™s various applications.
